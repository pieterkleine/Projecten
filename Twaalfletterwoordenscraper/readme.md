# Twaalfletterwoordenscraper

A program to scrape all Dutch 12 letter words from the 68 pages of https://nl.wikwik.org/woorden12letter.htm.
The program compiles the scraped words into one list, which is exported to a utf-8 txt file.

Kept it simple, as I just need the .txt for further data analysis. I want to find out whether there are significant commonalities between words. For example which combination of letters occur most often.
